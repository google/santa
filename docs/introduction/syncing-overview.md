# Syncing Overview

#### Background

Santa can be run and configured without a sync server. Doing so will enable an
admin to configure rules with the `santactl rule` command. Using a sync server
will enable an admin to configures rules and multiple other settings from the
sync server itself. Santa was designed from the start with a sync server in
mind. This allows an admin to easily configure and sync rules across a fleet of
macOS systems. This document explains the syncing process.

#### Flow of a full sync

This is a high level overview of the syncing process. For a more a more detailed
account of each part, see the respective documentation. The santaclt binary can
be run in one of two modes, daemon and non-daemon. The non-daemon mode does one
full sync and exits. This is the typical way a user will interact with Santa,
mainly to force a full sync. The daemon mode is used by santad to schedule full
syncs, listen for push notifications and upload events.

1.  When the santad process starts up, it looks for a `SyncBaseURL` key/value in
    the config. If one exists it will `fork()` and `execve()` `santactl sync
    â€”-daemon`. Before the new process calls `execve()`, all privileges are
    dropped. All privileged actions are then restricted to the XPC interface
    made available to santactl by santad. Since this santactl process is running
    as a daemon it too exports an XPC interface so santad can interact with the
    process efficiently and securely. To ensure syncing reliability santad will
    restart the santactl daemon if it is killed or crashes.
2.  The santactl daemon process now schedules a full sync for 15 sec in the
    future. The 15 sec is used to let santad settle before santactl starts
    sending rules from the sync server to process.
3.  The full sync starts. There are a number of stages to a full sync:
    1.  preflight: The sync server can set various settings for Santa.
    2.  logupload (optional): The sync server can request that the Santa logs be
        uploaded to an endpoint.
    3.  eventupload (optional): If Santa has generated events, it will upload
        them to the sync-server.
    4.  ruledownload: Download rules from the sync server.
    5.  postflight: Updates timestamps for successful syncs.
4.  After the full sync completes a new full sync will be scheduled, by default
    this will be 10min. However there are a few ways to manipulate this:
    1.  The sync server can send down a configuration in the preflight to
        override the 10min interval. It can be anything greater than 10min.
    2.  Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) can be used. The sync server can send
        down a configuration in the preflight to have the santactl daemon to
        start listening for FCM messages. If a connection to FCM is made, the
        full sync interval drops to a default of 4 hours. This can be further
        configured by a preflight configuration. The FCM connection allows the
        sync-sever to talk directly with Santa. This way we can reduce polling
        the sync server dramatically.
5.  Full syncs will continue to take place at their configured interval. If
    configured FCM messages will continue to be digested and acted upon.

#### santactl XPC interface

When running as a daemon, the santactl process makes available an XPC interface
for use by santad. This allows santad to send blocked binary or bundle events
directly to santactl for immediate upload to the sync-server, enabling a
smoother user experience. The binary that was blocked on macOS is immediately
available for viewing or handling on the sync-server.
