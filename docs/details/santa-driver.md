# santa-driver

santa-driver is a macOS
[kernel extension](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Darwin/Conceptual/KEXTConcept/KEXTConceptIntro/introduction.html)
(KEXT) that makes use of the
[Kernel Authorization](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/technotes/tn2127/_index.html)
(Kauth) KPI. This allows santa-driver to listen for events and either deny or
defer the decision of those events. The santa-driver acts as an intermediary
layer between Kauth and santad, with some caching to lower the overhead of
decision making.

##### Kauth

santa-driver utilizes two Kauth scopes `KAUTH_SCOPE_VNODE` and
`KAUTH_SCOPE_FILEOP`. It registers itself with the Kauth API by calling
`kauth_listen_scope()` for each scope. This function takes three arguments:

*   `const char *scope`
*   `kauth_scope_callback_t _callback`
*   `void *context`

It returns a `kauth_listener_t` that is stored for later use, in Santa's case to
stop listening.

###### KAUTH_SCOPE_VNODE

Here is how santa-driver starts listening for `KAUTH_SCOPE_VNODE` events.

```c++
vnode_listener_ = kauth_listen_scope(
    KAUTH_SCOPE_VNODE, vnode_scope_callback, reinterpret_cast<void *>(this));
```

The function `vnode_scope_callback` is called for every vnode event. There are
many types of vnode events, they complete list can be viewed in the kauth.h.
There are many types of vnode events, the complete list can be viewed in
kauth.h. Santa is only concerned with regular files generating
`KAUTH_VNODE_EXECUTE` [1] and `KAUTH_VNODE_WRITE_DATA` events. All non-regular
files and unnecessary vnode events are filtered out.

Here is how santa-driver stops listening for `KAUTH_SCOPE_VNODE` events:

```c++
kauth_unlisten_scope(vnode_listener_);
```

[1] `KAUTH_VNODE_EXECUTE` events that do not have the `KAUTH_VNODE_ACCESS`
advisory bit set.

###### KAUTH_SCOPE_FILEOP

Santa also listens for file operations, this is mainly used for logging [1] and
cache invalidation.

*   `KAUTH_FILEOP_DELETE`, `KAUTH_FILEOP_RENAME`, `KAUTH_FILEOP_EXCHANGE` and
    `KAUTH_FILEOP_LINK` are logged
*   `KAUTH_FILEOP_EXEC` is used to log `execve()`s. Since the
    `KAUTH_VNODE_EXECUTE` is used to allow or deny an `execve()` the process
    arguments have not been setup yet. Since `KAUTH_FILEOP_EXEC` is triggered
    after an `execve()` it is used to log the `execve()`.

[1] `KAUTH_FILEOP_CLOSE` is used to invalidate that file's representation in the
cache. If a file has changed it needs to be re-evalauted. This is particularly
necessary for files that were added to the cache with an action of allow.

##### Driver Interface

santa-driver implements an
[IOUserClient](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/kernel/iouserclient?language=objc)
subclass and santad interacts with it through IOKit/IOKitLib.h functions.

##### Cache

To aid in performance, santa-driver utilizes a caching system to hold the state
of all observed `execve()` events.

###### Key

The key is a `uint64_t`. The top 32 bits hold the filesystem ID, while the
bottom 32 bits hold the file unique ID. Together we call this the vnode_id.

```c++
uint64_t vnode_id = (((uint64_t)fsid << 32) | fileid);
```

###### Value

The value is a `uint64_t` containing the action necessary, along with the
decision timestamp. The action is stored in the top 8 bits. The decision
timestamp is stored in the remaining 56 bits.

```c++
santa_action_t action = (santa_action_t)(cache_val >> 56);
uint64_t decision_time = (cache_val & ~(0xFF00000000000000));
```

The possible actions are:

| Actions                 | Expiry Time      | Description                    |
| ----------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `ACTION_REQUEST_BINARY` | None             | Awaiting an allow or deny      |
|                         |                  | decision from santad.          |
| `ACTION_RESPOND_ALLOW`  | None             | Allow the `execve()`           |
| `ACTION_RESPOND_DENY`   | 500 milliseconds | Deny the `execve()`, but       |
|                         |                  | re-evalaute after 500          |
|                         |                  | milliseconds. If someone is    |
|                         |                  | trying to run a banned binary  |
|                         |                  | continually every millisecond  |
|                         |                  | for example, only 2 evaluation |
|                         |                  | requests to santad for would   |
|                         |                  | occur per second. This         |
|                         |                  | mitigates a denial of service  |
|                         |                  | type attack on santad.         |

###### Invalidation

Besides the expiry time for individual entries, the entire cache will be cleared
if any of the following events takes place:

*   Addition of a block rule
*   Change to the blocked path regex
*   Cache fills up. This defaults to `5000` entries for the root volume and
    `500` for all other mounted volumes.

To view the current kernel cache count see the "Kernel info" section of
`santactl status`:

```sh
â‡’  santactl status
>>> Kernel Info
    Root cache count          | 107
    Non-root cache count      | 0
```
