# Building

Santa uses [Bazel](https://bazel.build) for building, testing and releases.
The `master` branch on GitHub is the source-of-truth with features developed
in personal forks.

#### Cloning

Clone the source and change into the directory.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/google/santa
cd santa
```

The above command will default to using the `master` branch. All releases are
built from tagged commits, so if you wanted to build, run or test a specific
release you can checkout that tag:

```sh
git checkout 0.9.30
```

If you want to list all the tags in reverse order:

```sh
git tag --sort=-creatordate
```

#### Building

Build a debug version of Santa:

```sh
bazel build :santa-driver
```

Build a release (optimized) version of Santa:

```sh
bazel build :santa-driver -c opt
```

The output for these commands will be a `santa-driver.zip` file under
`bazel-bin` which, when extracted, will contain all of Santa and should be
installed under `/Library/Extensions`. However, if you're working on Santa
and want a quick way to reload everything, see the next section.

#### Running

When working on Santa, it's useful to have a way to quickly reload all of the
Santa components. For this reason, there's a special rule in the Santa BUILD
file that will compile a new santa-driver, unload Santa if it's running,
install the new Santa in the right place and attempt to load it.

On macOS 10.11+ System Integrity Protection (SIP) prevents loading of kernel
extensions that are not signed by an Apple KEXT signing certificate. To be able
to load and test a non-release version of Santa, SIP will have to be configured
to allow non-Apple KEXT signing certificates.

__This is only to be done a machine that is actively developing, unloading and
loading kernel extensions.__

1. Boot into Recovery Mode: Reboot and hold down `command+r`
2. From the utilities menu select `Terminal`
3. Disable the KEXT feature of SIP: `csrutil enable --without kext`
4. Reboot

You should now be able to load and run a non-release version of Santa.

Build and run a debug version of Santa.

```sh
bazel run :reload
```

Build and run a release version of Santa.

```sh
bazel run :reload -c opt
```

#### Using Xcode

While Bazel is a very convenient and powerful build system, it can still be
useful to use Xcode for actually working on the code. If you'd like to use
Xcode you can use [Tulsi](https://tulsi.bazel.build) to generate an `.xcodeproj`
from the BUILD file which will use Bazel for actually doing the builds.

#### Debugging

Xcode and lldb can be used to debug Santa, similarly to any other project, with
some exceptions. Instead of clicking the play button to launch and attach to a
process, you can attach to an already running, or soon to by running, component
of Santa. To do this select the Debug menu and choose `Attach to Process by PID
or Name… `. Below are the four components of Santa and who to debug the process
as.

Note: santa-driver (the kernel extension) cannot be debugged by attaching with
Xcode.

Note: Xcode can attach to santad without interruption, however any breakpoints
in the decision making codepath can deadlock the machine. Using lldb directly
to attach to santad will deadlock the machine.

| process  | user |
| -------- | ---- |
| santad   | root |
| Santa*   | me   |
| santactl | me   |
| santabs  | root |

Xcode will then wait for the process to start. Issue this command to restart
all the Santa processes in debug mode.

*The Santa (GUI) process is the only component of Santa that can be launched
and debugged from Xcode directly. All the other components are launched with
privileges and/or are scoped to an XPC service that launchd scopes to a hosting
bundle. Thus the need for the `Attach to Process by PID or Name…` technique.
See the [ipc](../details/ipc.md) document for for details.

```sh
bazel run :reload
```

Now the process is attached in Xcode and you can debug your day away.

#### Tests

Run all the logic / unit tests

```sh
bazel test :logic_tests
```

Run all of santa-driver kernel extension tests

```sh
bazel run :kernel_tests
```

#### Releases

Creates a release build of Santa with a version based of the newest tag. Also
saves the dsym files for each component of Santa. This makes debugging and
interpreting future crashes or kernel panics much easier.

```sh
bazel run :release
```
