# santasyncservice

The `santasyncservice` daemon is responsible for performing all sync service
interactions.

Information on syncing can be found in the
[Syncing Overview](../introduction/syncing-overview.md) document.

Please refer to the [Sync Protocol](../development/sync-protocol.md) document
for full details on how to implement your own sync server.
