##### Monitor mode

This is the default mode. Running Santa in Monitor will not stop unknown binaries from running. It will stop binaries matching blacklist rules. This is a flexible state, allowing virtually zero user interruption but still gives protection against known blacklisted binaries. In addition execution events that would have been blocked in Lockdown mode are generated and can be collected and analyzed by a sync-server.

##### Lockdown mode

Running Santa in Lockdown mode will stop any unknown binaries from running. Meaning, if the binary has no rules or scopes that apply, it will be blocked.

##### Changing Modes

There are two ways to change the running mode. One is by changing the config.plist. The `ClientMode` key is protected while santad is running and will revert any attempt to change it.

Change to __Monitor__ mode without a sync-server:

```sh
sudo launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.google.santad.plist
sudo defaults write /var/db/santa/config.plist ClientMode -int 1
sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.google.santad.plist
```

Change to __Lockdown__ mode without a sync-server:

```sh
sudo launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.google.santad.plist
sudo defaults write /var/db/santa/config.plist ClientMode -int 2
sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.google.santad.plist
```

Change modes with a __sync-server__:

The mode is set in the preflight sync stage. Use the key `client_mode` and a value of `MONITOR` or `LOCKDOWN`.
