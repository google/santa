##### Monitor mode

The default mode. Running Santa in Monitor Mode will stop any binaries matching blacklist rules, but will not stop unknown binaries from running. This is a flexible state, allowing virtually zero user interruption but still gives protection against known blacklisted binaries. In addition execution events that would have been blocked in Lockdown mode are generated and can be collected and analyzed by a sync server.

##### Lockdown mode

Running Santa in Lockdown Mode will stop all blacklisted binaries and additionally will prevent all unknown binaries from running. This means that if the binary has no rules or scopes that apply, then it will be blocked.

##### Changing Modes

There are two ways to change the running mode: changing the config.plist and with a sync server configuration.

###### Change modes with the config.plist

The `ClientMode` config key is protected while santad is running and will revert any attempt to change it.

Change to Monitor mode:

```sh
sudo launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.google.santad.plist
sudo defaults write /var/db/santa/config.plist ClientMode -int 1
sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.google.santad.plist
```

Change to Lockdown mode:

```sh
sudo launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.google.santad.plist
sudo defaults write /var/db/santa/config.plist ClientMode -int 2
sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.google.santad.plist
```

######Change modes with a sync server

The mode is set in the preflight sync stage. Use the key `client_mode` and a value of `MONITOR` or `LOCKDOWN`.
