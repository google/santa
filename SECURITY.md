# Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, we would appreciate a private report
so that we can work on and release a fix before public disclosure. Any vulnerabilities reported to us will be
disclosed publicly either when a new version with fixes is released or 90 days has passed,
whichever comes first.

To report vulnerabilities to us privately, either:

1) Report the vulnerability [through GitHub](https://github.com/google/santa/security/advisories/new).

2) E-mail `santa-team@google.com`. If you want to encrypt your e-mail, you can use our GPG key `0x92AFE41DAB49BBB6` available on keyserver.ubuntu.com:

    `gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-key 0x92AFE41DAB49BBB6`
