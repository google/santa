/**
  A wrapper around NSXPCListener and NSXPCConnection to provide client multiplexing, signature
  validation of connecting clients and forced connection establishment.

  Example server started by @c launchd where the @c launchd job has a @c MachServices key:

  @code
   SNTXPCConnection *conn = [[SNTXPCConnection alloc] initServerWithName:@"MyServer"];
   conn.exportedInterface = [NSXPCInterface interfaceWithProtocol:@protocol(MyServerProtocol)];
   conn.exportedObject = myObject;
   [conn resume];
  @endcode

  Example client, connecting to above server:

  @code
   SNTXPCConnection *conn = [[SNTXPCConnection alloc] initClientWithName:"MyServer"
                                                             withOptions:0];
   conn.remoteInterface = [NSXPCInterface interfaceWithProtocol:@protocol(MyServerProtocol)];
   conn.invalidationHandler = ^{ NSLog(@"Connection invalidated") };
   [conn resume];
  @endcode

  The client can send a message to the server with:

  @code
   [conn.remoteObjectProxy selectorInRemoteInterface];
  @endcode

  One advantage of the way that SNTXPCConnection works over using NSXPCConnection directly is that
  from the client-side once the resume method has finished, the connection is either valid or the
  invalidation handler will be called. Ordinarily, the connection doesn't actually get made until
  the first message is sent across it.

  @note messages are always delivered on a background thread!
