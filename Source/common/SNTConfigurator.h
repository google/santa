///  A list of ignore prefixes which are checked in-kernel.
///  This is more performant than FileChangesRegex when ignoring whole directory trees.
///
///  For example adding a prefix of "/private/tmp/" will turn off file change log generation
///  in-kernel for that entire tree. Since they are ignored by the kernel, they never reach santad
///  and are not seen by the fileChangesRegex. Note the trailing "/", without it any file or
///  directory starting with "/private/tmp" would be ignored.
///
///  By default "/." and "/dev/" are added.
///
///  Memory in the kernel is precious. A total of MAXPATHLEN (1024) nodes are allowed.
///  Using all 1024 nodes will result in santa-driver allocating ~2MB of wired memory.
///  An ASCII character uses 1 node. An UTF-8 encoded Unicode character uses 1-4 nodes.
///  Prefixes are added to the running config in-order, one by one. The prefix will be ignored if
///  (the running config's current size) + (the prefix's size) totals up to more than 1024 nodes.
///  The running config is stored in a prefix tree.
///  Prefixes that share prefixes are effectively de-duped; their shared node sized components only
///  take up 1 node. For example these 3 prefixes all have a common prefix of "/private/".
///  They will only take up 21 nodes instead of 39.
